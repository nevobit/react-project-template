## Real Vision React Template

This is a project template for React apps.

To create a new project based on this template use:

### Get started

Install the dependenciers

```
    cd react-project-template
    npm install
```

Run project

```
    npm start
```

Navigate to localhost:3000. YOut should see your app running. Edit a component file in src, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. 

If you are using **Visual Studio Code** we recommend installing the official extension React for VS Code. If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

### Regular dependencies

- React-reduc
- react-router-dom
- redux
- redux-thunk
- axios 
- timeago.js
